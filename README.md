# disneydeck

Disney Deck was my final project for my Digital Media Design major, developed in 2017-2018 at Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro.

<b>CONCEPT</b>

Disney Deck is an online portal about travel with a focus on the Disney parks in Orlando, Florida, providing complete and quality content entirely in Portuguese.

In here are a few pieces of the final website.

<b>TOOLS</b>

HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, jQuery
